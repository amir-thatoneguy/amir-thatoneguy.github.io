## ML Workshops
I've had the great opportunity to give lectures in two summer machine learning workshops (2022 and 2023), held by the Scientific Association of The Electrical Engineering Department at Sharif University. The lectures introduced students (about 60 in 2023) to various topics, ranging from an introduction to artificial intelligence as a whole to clustering, tree-based methods, SVMs, and more.

## Teaching Assistance
I've been a teaching assistant for multiple courses throughout the past three years.
