## ML Workshops
I've had the great opportunity to give lectures in two summer machine learning workshops (2022 and 2023), held by the Scientific Association of The Electrical Engineering Department at Sharif University. The lectures introduced students (about 60 in 2023) to various topics, ranging from an introduction to artificial intelligence as a whole to clustering, tree-based methods, SVMs, and more.

### 2022
This is the link to the 2022 workshop materials. The workshop consisted of 6 sessions, providing a basic yet grounded introduction to classical machine learning for the participants. We tried to make the workshop engaging and modern. I gave the lectures on unsupervised learning, SVMs, and tree-based learning algorithms.

### 2023
This is the link to the 2023 workshop materials. This time around we tried to make the course more interesting for a general audience. We focused more on the concepts and less on mathematical derivations. I did however provide information on approaching the mathematical side of things for the interested. I gave the first two lectures (5 total), cosisting of an introduction to machine learning and its current applications, linear ang logistic regression, and later on SVMs and tree-based algorithms.


## Teaching Assistance
I've been a teaching assistant for multiple courses throughout the past three years. These include Object-Oriented Programming (formerly Advanced Programming), Introduction to Machine Learning, and Linear Algebra (Mathematical Methods in Engineering).
