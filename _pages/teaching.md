## ML Workshops
I've had the great opportunity to give lectures in two summer machine learning workshops (2022 and 2023), held by the Scientific Association of The Electrical Engineering Department at Sharif University. The lectures introduced students (about 60 in 2023) to various topics, ranging from an introduction to artificial intelligence as a whole to clustering, tree-based methods, SVMs, and more.

### [2022](https://github.com/amir-thatoneguy/Machine-Learning-ESW)
The 2022 workshop consisted of 6 sessions, providing a basic yet mathematically grounded introduction to classical machine learning for the participants. We tried to make the workshop engaging and modern. I gave the lectures on unsupervised learning, SVMs, and tree-based learning algorithms.

### [2023](https://github.com/amir-thatoneguy/AIvengers-Intro-to-ML)
This time around we tried to make the course more interesting for a wider audience. We focused more on the concepts and less on mathematical derivations. I did however provide information on approaching the mathematical side of things for the interested. I gave the first two lectures (5 total), cosisting of an introduction to machine learning and its current applications, linear ang logistic regression, and later on SVMs and tree-based algorithms.


## Teaching Assistance
I've been a teaching assistant for multiple courses. These include Object-Oriented Programming (formerly Advanced Programming), Introduction to Machine Learning, and Linear Algebra (Mathematical Methods in Engineering). 

### Introduction to Machine Learning
For the course offered by the IE departmnet, I created the materials for the autoencoders and GANs sessions ([here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oJPbMPNHe-TOZ-yJx_pPuMg5CNCCnxfB/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105644808195847419044&rtpof=true&sd=true)). For the courses offered by the EE department I've mostly helped with the course projects (2023, Dr. Amini, 2023, Dr. Shamsollahi). 

I also designed homeworks. See [this](https://amir-thatoneguy.github.io/assets/pdf/sol4_ml.pdf) for an example.

### Object-Oriented Programming
I was the course project head in the 2022 course. The project I designed was a simple social media app with a simple recommender system. The recommender system consisted of simple neighbor aggregation for finding non-neighboring nodes with the highest number of common neighbors, and ranking them online for suggestions (a friends-of-friends approach).
