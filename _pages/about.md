I'm Mohammad Mahdi (I go by the name Amir), a 23 year old student at the EE department of the [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology), Tehran. I spend most of my time doing research, especially on taking a mathematical approach to applied problems in machine learning.

My broad research interests are applied probability, trustowrthy and secure machine learning (differential privacy, out-of-distribution detection and generalization, etc.), and the theory of deep learning (optmization behaviours, understanding deep representations, etc.). 

I've recently had the great opportunity to start working and collaborating on several research projects I'm passionate about, including one at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) at London with Dr. Gholamali Aminian, and another one at the [Data Science and Machine Learning Laboratory (DML)](http://dml.ir/) at Tehran with Prof. Hamid R. Rabiee. <br>

[Here's](https://amir-thatoneguy.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_Conciser%20(1).pdf) a short resume of mine. See the [projects](https://amir-thatoneguy.github.io/projects/) and [teaching](https://amir-thatoneguy.github.io/teaching/) pages for detailed information on what I do.
