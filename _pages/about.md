I'm Mohammad Mahdi (I go by the name Amir), a student at the EE department of the [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology), Tehran. I spend most of my time doing research, especially on taking a mathematical approach to problems in machine learning.

I've recently had the great opportunity to start working and collaborating on multiple research projects I'm passionate about, including one at The Alan Turing Institute at London with Dr. Gholamali Aminian. <br>

[Here's](https://amir-thatoneguy.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_Conciser%20(5).pdf) a short resume of mine. See the [repositories](https://amir-thatoneguy.github.io/repositories/) and [teaching](https://amir-thatoneguy.github.io/teaching/) pages for detailed information on what I do.


## Interests
My broad research interests are applied probability, trustowrthy machine learning (differential privacy, out-of-distribution detection and generalization, etc.), and the theory of deep learning (optmization behaviours, understanding deep representations, etc.). 

When not working, I take hours-long walks outside, talk about life with friends, listen to extreme metal ([Vildjharta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSrMw_VbanM&ab_channel=CenturyMediaRecords) is a favorite), listen to classical music (usually [Rachmaninoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbbtmskCRUY&ab_channel=Variatio24)), and sometimes play the piano (and fail at it).
