I'm Mohammad Mahdi (I go by the name Amir), a 23 year old student at the EE department of the [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology), Tehran. I spend most of my time doing research, especially on taking a mathematical approach to applied problems in machine learning.

I've recently had the great opportunity to start working and collaborating on multiple research projects I'm passionate about, including one at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) at London with Dr. Gholamali Aminian, and another one at the [Data Science and Machine Learning Laboratory (DML)](http://dml.ir/) at Tehran with Prof. Hamid R. Rabiee. <br>

[Here's](https://amir-thatoneguy.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_Conciser%20(1).pdf) a short resume of mine. See the [repositories](https://amir-thatoneguy.github.io/repositories/) and [teaching](https://amir-thatoneguy.github.io/teaching/) pages for detailed information on what I do.


## Interests
My broad research interests are applied probability, trustowrthy and secure machine learning (differential privacy, out-of-distribution detection and generalization, etc.), and the theory of deep learning (optmization behaviours, understanding deep representations, etc.). 

When not working, I take hours-long walks outside, talk about life with friends, listen to extreme metal ([Vildjharta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSrMw_VbanM&ab_channel=CenturyMediaRecords) is a favorite), listen to classical music (usually [Rachmaninoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbbtmskCRUY&ab_channel=Variatio24)), and sometimes play the piano (and fail at it).
