I'm Mohammad Mahdi (I go by the name Amir), a 23 year old student at the EE department of the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran. I spend most of my time doing research, especially on taking a mathematical approach to applied problems in machine learning.

My broad research interests are applied probability, trustowrthy and secure machine learning (differential privacy, out-of-distribution detection and generalization, etc.), and the theory of deep learning (optmization behaviours, understanding deep representations, etc.). 

I've been lucky to work and collaborate on projects with several laboratories and research institutions, including The Alan Turing Institute at London, England and the Data Science and Machine Learning Laboratory (DML) at Tehran, Iran.

Here's a short resume of mine. See the projects and teaching pages for detailed information on what I do.
